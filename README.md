## 🎃 Contributing — read this bit

**This repository exists so you can make your first pull request.** That is not
marketing. The issues were written specifically for people who have never
contributed to open source before.

### The fastest way in

1. Browse [issues labelled `good first issue`](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
2. Comment **`/claim`** on one — a bot assigns it to you within seconds
3. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
4. Open a pull request with `Closes #<issue number>` in the description

### Three kinds of work here

| | |
|---|---|
| 🎮 **Add a game** | One new file, one line in a list. [Step-by-step guide with working code](docs/how-to-add-a-game.md) |
| 🐛 **Fix a bug** | There are real bugs in here on purpose. Each issue names the exact file and function |
| ✨ **Improve a game** | Difficulty levels, better ASCII art, an opponent that actually tries to win |

Every issue tells you the file to open, what "done" looks like, and how to
check your work. If an issue does not do that, it is our mistake — say so and
we will fix it.

## Project layout

```
terminal-arcade/
├── arcade/
│   ├── __main__.py      # python -m arcade starts here
│   ├── main.py          # the menu and the list of games
│   ├── art.py           # ASCII banners and colours
│   ├── input_utils.py   # asking the player questions

```

## Running the tests

Tests need `pytest`, which is the only thing in this project that does:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pytest
python3 -m pytest
```

## Design rules

- **Standard library only.** Ever. This gets used at events on campus Wi-Fi,
  and `pip install` failing must never be why someone cannot take part
- **One file per game.** So contributors never collide with each other
- **Every game returns a score** from `play()`, and `main.py` decides what to
  do with it
- **Only `input_utils` calls `input()`**, so "that is not a number" behaves the
  same everywhere

More detail in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
